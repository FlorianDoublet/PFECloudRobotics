h1. The left-right tilt (aka. "drone roll" or phi
     *            angle) argument is a percentage of the maximum inclination as
     *            configured here. A negative value makes the drone tilt to its
     *            left, thus flying leftward. A positive value makes the drone
     *            tilt to its right, thus flying rightward.

Attributes of ar_drone are:

| *Attribute* | *Type* | *Required* | *Mutable* | *Default* | *Description* |
| name | <a href="core.textile#datatype-string">String</a> | false | true |  |  |
| left_right_tilt | <a href="core.textile#datatype-number">Number</a> | true | true |  | The left-right tilt (aka. "drone roll" or phi
     *            angle) argument is a percentage of the maximum inclination as
     *            configured here. A negative value makes the drone tilt to its
     *            left, thus flying leftward. A positive value makes the drone
     *            tilt to its right, thus flying rightward. |
| front_back_tilt | <a href="core.textile#datatype-number">Number</a> | true | true |  | The front-back tilt (aka. "drone pitch" or theta
     *            angle) argument is a percentage of the maximum inclination as
     *            configured here. A negative value makes the drone lower its
     *            nose, thus flying frontward. A positive value makes the drone
     *            raise its nose, thus flying backward. The drone translation
     *            speed in the horizontal plane depends on the environment and
     *            cannot be determined. With roll or pitch values set to 0, the
     *            drone will stay horizontal but continue sliding in the air
     *            because of its inertia. Only the air resistance will then make
     *            it stop. |
| vertical_speed | <a href="core.textile#datatype-number">Number</a> | true | true |  | The vertical speed (aka. "gaz") argument is a
     *            percentage of the maximum vertical speed as defined here. A
     *            positive value makes the drone rise in the air. A negative
     *            value makes it go down. |
| angular_speed | <a href="core.textile#datatype-number">Number</a> | true | true |  | The angular speed argument is a percentage of the
     *            maximum angular speed as defined here. A positive value makes
     *            the drone spin right; a negative value makes it spin left. |
